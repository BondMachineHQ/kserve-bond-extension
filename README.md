# kserve-bond-extension

Project that extends KServe predictors, an emerging standard for ML (Machine Learning) model inference as a service on kubernetes. This project will support a custom workflow capable of loading and serving models on-demand on top of FPGAs. A key aspect is that the proposed approach makes the firmware generation transparent, often an obstacle to a widespread FPGA adoption.
